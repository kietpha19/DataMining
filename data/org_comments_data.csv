Nobody in the question is mentioned that the rock falls and accelerates at 9.8 meter per second. Rounding that up to 10m/s you can say the rock falls 10m on the first second, 20m on the second second, 30m on the third second etc. So the question assumes that the rock accelerates to infinity at the exact same rate. In reality the rock may accelerates for a few seconds but then reach its maximum speed of lets say 100m/s. In theory i believe sound also needs some time to accelerate to 346m/s and doesn't start instantly off 346m/s. I'm not sure about the sound, but the rock definitely doesn't accelerate how assumed in the video. And since the fall speed is already entirely based on assumptions, since the 9.8m/s is mentioned nowhere in the question, neither whether or not it reaches a maximum speed or not like in reality, you can't really answer this question given just the information given in the question. In reality you would need a lot more information about the physics of the rock and the air to first of all properly calculate the rock's fall and acceleration speed. Even when approtiating the height, i think the real answer would be more like a height of something between 600m and 1000m. I'm not sure if the slowed acceleration would increase or decrease the height of the building, i think decrease? I'm generally too dumb to solve this question lol but i just wanted to mention that the question lacks a lot of information to really solve it and is largely based on physic assumptions that don't even make sense. You could replace the rock with a human.. or an asteroid.. and would get the same answer using the same assumptions in the video. So this shows how flawed this question/problem is. Including the air temperature, but ignoring all these other things is also quite funny. All we can really say from the question is that the building has at least a size UNDER 15.1*346meters.

temperatures\r\nin the top example we're reacting it at\r\na low temperature of 25 degrees Celsius\r\nand in the bottom example at a higher\r\ntemperature\r\nat 95 degrees Celsius\r\nwhat's going to be the major product for\r\nthis reaction and what mechanism will it\r\nproceed by\r\nnow in both cases we're dealing with a\r\ntertiary alkyl halide\r\nso we're not going to get the sn2\r\nreaction\r\nthe substrate is two sterically hinted\r\nfor that\r\nnow we don't have a strong base\r\niodide is a good nucleophile very very\r\nvery weak base\r\nwater is a better base than iodide\r\nso water will be the weak base iodide is\r\nthe good nucleophile\r\nbecause we don't have a strong base\r\nwe're not going to get the E2 reaction\r\nso what we're going to get is a mixture\r\nof the sn1 and E1 reaction\r\nwe have a tertiary alkyl halide a decent\r\nnucleophile and a weak base which is the\r\nsolvent\r\nnow what you need to understand is that\r\nas we increase the temperature\r\nwe're going to get more of the E1\r\nreaction\r\nso as the temperature goes up\r\nthe yield of the E1 reaction increases\r\nthe yield of the S1 reaction decreases\r\nas we decrease the temperature we get\r\nmore of the S1 product and less of the\r\nE1 product\r\nso high temperatures favor the E1\r\nreaction low temperatures favor the S1\r\nreaction\r\nso this is going to proceed by the S1\r\nmechanism the second example will\r\nproceed via the E1 mechanism\r\nin both cases\r\nin the first example\r\nwe're going to replace chloride with\r\niodide\r\nthe water really doesn't need to react\r\nin this example\r\nwhat it's going to do is going to\r\nsolvate the carbocation\r\nbut we will get chloride\r\nas a side product\r\nso those are the products for the first\r\nreaction in the second example because\r\nwe get an elimination\r\nwe're going to form a double bond\r\nchloride will be expelled\r\nand water\r\nis going to abstract a proton\r\nand we're going to get\r\nyou could think of it as iodide and h3o\r\nplus\r\nbut if you were to subtract water as a\r\nreactant and as a product\r\nyou can treat this\r\nas h i\r\nif you take away water from H2O plus\r\nit's basically h plus and I minus\r\nbut now with that being said\r\nwhy does an increase in temperature\r\nfavor\r\nthe E1 reaction over the sn1 reaction\r\nwhy does why do high temperatures favor\r\nelimination over substitution\r\nwell there's two big reasons\r\nthe first one has to do with\r\nthermodynamics\r\nperhaps you recall the equation\r\nDelta G gives free energy is equal to\r\nDelta H the enthalpy minus t Delta s the\r\nchange in entropy\r\nnow an increase in temperature enhances\r\nthe entropy effect\r\nif we look at the reactions for S and\r\none and E1 that we have here\r\nnotice that the S1 reaction we have two\r\nreactants and two products\r\nso in terms of the number of\r\nmolecules and ions that we have here\r\nthere's no net change it's two for two\r\nbut for the E1 reaction\r\nwe have two reactants three products\r\nso\r\nthere's an increase in entropy for the\r\nE1 reaction\r\nas we increase the temperature it's\r\ngoing to enhance the entropy effect\r\nbecause this term T Delta s\r\nwill increase as well the absolute value\r\nof T Delta s will increase as\r\ntemperature increases now we do have a\r\nnegative sign in front of that\r\nand so as this increases\r\nit's going to cause Delta G to decrease\r\nor become more negative\r\nand we know that a negative Delta G\r\nvalue indicates a spontaneous reaction\r\nso in other words\r\nincrease in the temperature\r\ncauses this reaction the E1 reaction to\r\nbecome more spontaneous\r\nso this reaction becomes more\r\nenergetically favorable\r\nwhen the temperature goes up\r\nthe position of equilibrium shifts to\r\nthe right as we increase the temperature\r\nit becomes more energetically favorable\r\nnow let's talk about the kinetics or the\r\nspeed of the reaction\r\nat low temperature\r\nthe reaction is under kinetic control\r\nthe sm1 reaction will occur faster under\r\nlow temperatures at high temperatures\r\nit's under thermodynamic control the\r\nenergetics favor the E1 reaction\r\nnow the E1 reaction\r\nit has a higher\r\nforward activation energy\r\nand that's why at low temperatures\r\nit doesn't proceed\r\nbecause it is a higher\r\nenergy barrier that must be overcome\r\nand so an increase of temperature will\r\nallow us to get over that higher energy\r\nbarrier but why is there a higher\r\nactivation energy\r\nfor the E1 reaction\r\nthis has to do with the number of bonds\r\nthat must be broken\r\nin order to get the E1 reaction going\r\nif we focus on the S1 reaction mechanism\r\nthe only bond that we need to break is\r\nthe carbon chlorine bond\r\nthat's the slow step\r\nnow remember anytime you break a bond\r\nthat's an endothermic reaction you need\r\nto put in energy to do that whenever a\r\nbond is formed energy is released that's\r\nan exothermic reaction\r\nso this step requires the input of\r\nenergy\r\nin the next example where iodide\r\ncombines with the carbocation\r\nenergy will be released so in this\r\nmechanism\r\nwe only need to bake we only need to\r\nbreak one bond that is the carbon\r\nchlorine bond\r\nnow for the E1 reaction\r\nwe also need to break the carbon\r\nchlorine bond to get the carbocation\r\nnow this step here\r\nis where's get it gets interesting\r\nbecause\r\nin the S1 reaction we don't need to\r\nbreak another Bond but for the E1\r\nreaction we do\r\nin order to get the E1 reaction going we\r\nneed to break another bond that is the\r\ncarbon hydrogen bond in order to form\r\nthat alkene\r\nso for this particular example\r\nin the S Sub 1 reaction we only need to\r\nbreak one Bond\r\nfor the E1 reaction\r\nwe have to break\r\ntwo bonds\r\nand so that requires a greater input of\r\nenergy to do that\r\nas a result there's a higher\r\nenergy\r\nbarrier or a higher activation energy\r\nthat we have to overcome to break those\r\ntwo bonds\r\nso that's why\r\nthe sn1 reaction is under kinetic\r\ncontrol\r\nit can occur faster at lower\r\ntemperatures because you only need to\r\nbreak one Bond\r\nfor the E1 reaction we need to break two\r\nbonds so we need more energy and that\r\nextra energy is available at higher\r\ntemperatures\r\nso now let's review what we've learned\r\nin summary\r\nthe reason why an increase in\r\ntemperature favors the elimination\r\nreaction\r\nover the substitution reaction has to do\r\nwith number one thermodynamics the\r\nelimination reaction is more\r\nenergetically favorable\r\ndue to an increase in entropy

in\r\ntemperature\r\nfavors the elimination reaction is\r\nbecause\r\nthe reaction becomes more spontaneous\r\ndue to the entropy effect\r\nas we increase the temperature\r\nthe second reason has to

the\r\nelimination reaction going as opposed to\r\nbreaking one bond for the S1 reaction\r\nand breaking two bonds requires a\r\ngreater input in energy than break in\r\none Bond\r\nso bond breaking

Giving you 32% as opposed to the 24% you'd have if you really had 300 oz total. \nAlso, I learned it differently. A more complete package if you will.\nThe way we learned is to make 100%. So if you have the percentage of the addition in the solution and the total volume, say oh Idk 17% salt and 340 mL of water, divide the 340 by 100 then multiply it by the percentage which is 17 which would get you 3.4 times 17 giving you 58.2. Now let's say you lose 120 mL of water, that 58.2 doesn't change. Now what you have to do is the same first steps. Divide (340-120, or 220) by 100. Now you have 2.2 instead of 3.4. Now divide your total amount of salt with that number and you get youur new percentage. Making the new percentage 26.5% rounded up to 1 decimal. It's a little more complicated but it's a much more complete package making it easier to understand why the numbers are what they are. Using the factors instead is quicker, sure, but how do you know for sure? Some other factor could interfere.

The phasing of the electric field with the magnetic field in the breast of EM waves is clear evidence that the wave mechanism does not work in a vacuum. The so-called electromagnetic waves are just some electromagnetic reliefs, made up of the chained circulations of the electric and magnetic fields. After deciphering the physical meaning of the action constant h, it can be demonstrated that at the level of each half-wave, the propulsive electromagnetic force is in balance with the inertial force, (BIl=m.a). This balance makes the sliding (translation) with a uniform rectilinear speed, of the scalar structure of the electromagnetic wave. The uniform-rectilinear speed and the transversal periodic structure give the wave appearance of E-M radiation. But the E-M radiation is only a dynamic structure similar to the linear electric motor, which glides through the vacuum at the speed of light, being propelled by the electromagnetic force, the force which is in balance with the inertia force.']"

I am a huge fun 🤩 of you🤘👏👏', 'String Theory was not a waste of time. Geometry is the key to Math and Physics.\r\n\r\nWhat if we describe subatomic particles as spatial curvature, instead of trying to describe General Relativity as being mediated by particles?\r\n\r\nQuantum Entangled Twisted Tubules:  ""A theory that you can\'t explain to a bartender is probably no damn good.""  Ernest Rutherford\r\n\r\nThe following is meant to be a generalized framework for an extension of Kaluza-Klein Theory.  Does it agree with the “Twistor Theory” of Roger Penrose?   During the early history of mankind, the twisting of fibers was used to produce thread, and this thread was used to produce fabrics.   The twist of the thread is locked up within these fabrics.  Is matter made up of twisted 3D-4D structures which store spatial curvature that we describe as “particles""?   Are the twist cycles the ""quanta"" of Quantum Mechanics?\r\n\r\nWhen we draw a sine wave on a blackboard, we are representing spatial curvature. Does a photon transfer spatial curvature from one location to another? Wrap a piece of wire around a pencil and it can produce a 3D coil of wire, much like a spring. When viewed from the side it can look like a two-dimensional sine wave. You could coil the wire with either a right-hand twist, or with a left-hand twist. Could Planck\'s Constant be proportional to the twist cycles. A photon with a higher frequency has more energy.  ( E=hf, More spatial curvature as the frequency increases = more Energy ). What if gluons are actually made up of these twisted tubes which become entangled with other tubes to produce quarks. (In the same way twisted electrical extension cords can become entangled.) Therefore, the gluons are a part of the quarks. Quarks cannot exist without gluons, and vice-versa. Mesons are made up of two entangled tubes (Quarks/Gluons), while protons and neutrons would be made up of three entangled tubes. (Quarks/Gluons) The ""Color Force"" would be related to the XYZ coordinates (orientation) of entanglement. ""Asymptotic Freedom"", and ""flux tubes"" are logically based on this concept. The Dirac “belt trick” also reveals the concept of twist in the ½ spin of subatomic particles.   If each twist cycle is proportional to h, we have identified the source of Quantum Mechanics as a consequence twist cycle geometry.  \r\n\r\nModern physicists say the Strong Force is mediated by a constant exchange of Mesons. The diagrams produced by some modern physicists actually represent the Strong Force like a spring connecting the two quarks. Asymptotic Freedom acts like real springs. Their drawing is actually more correct than their theory and matches perfectly to what I am saying in this model. You cannot separate the Gluons from the Quarks because they are a part of the same thing. The Quarks are the places where the Gluons are entangled with each other. \r\n\r\nNeutrinos would be made up of a twisted torus (like a twisted donut) within this model. The twist in the torus can either be Right-Hand or Left-Hand.   Some twisted donuts can be larger than others, which can produce three different types of neutrinos.   Gravity is a result of a very small curvature imbalance within atoms. (This is why the force of gravity is so small.) Instead of attempting to explain matter as ""particles"", this concept attempts to explain matter more in the manner of our current understanding of the space-time curvature of gravity. If an electron has qualities of both a particle and a wave, it cannot be either one. It must be something else. Therefore, a ""particle"" is actually a structure which stores spatial curvature. Can an electron-positron pair (which are made up of opposite directions of twist) annihilate each other by unwinding into each other producing Gamma Ray photons?  \r\n\r\nDoes an electron travel through space like a threaded nut traveling down a threaded rod, with each twist cycle proportional to Planck’s Constant?  Does it wind up on one end, while unwinding on the other end?   Is this related to the Higgs field?  Does this help explain the strange ½ spin of many subatomic particles?  Does the 720 degree rotation of a 1/2 spin particle require at least one extra dimension? \r\n\r\n Alpha decay occurs when the two protons and two neutrons (which are bound together by entangled tubes), become un-entangled from the rest of the nucleons\r\n\r\n. Beta decay occurs when the tube of a down quark/gluon in a neutron becomes overtwisted and breaks producing a twisted torus (neutrino) and an up quark, and the ejected electron. The phenomenon of Supercoiling involving twist and writhe cycles may reveal how overtwisted quarks can produce these new particles. The conversion of twists into writhes, and vice-versa, is an interesting process.\r\n\r\n Gamma photons are produced when a tube unwinds producing electromagnetic waves.\r\n\r\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\r\nWithin this model a black hole could represent a quantum of gravity, because it is one cycle of spatial gravitational curvature.   Therefore, instead of a graviton being a subatomic particle it could be considered to be a black hole.   The overall gravitational attraction would be caused by a very tiny curvature imbalance within atoms.  We know there is an unequal distribution of electrical charge within each atom because the positive charge is concentrated within the nucleus, even though the overall electrical charge of the atom is balanced by equal positive and negative charge.\r\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\r\nIn this model Alpha equals the compactification ratio within the twistor cone, which is approximately  1/137.\r\n\r\n1= Hypertubule diameter at 4D interface\r\n\r\n137= Cone’s larger end diameter at 3D interface where the photons are absorbed or emitted.\r\n\r\nThe 4D twisted Hypertubule gets longer or shorter as twisting or untwisting occurs.   (720 degrees per twist cycle.)  \r\n\r\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\r\nHow many neutrinos are left over from the Big Bang?  They have a small mass, but they could be very large in number.     Could this help explain Dark Matter?\r\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\r\n\r\nWhy did Paul Dirac use the twist in a belt to help explain particle spin?  Is Dirac’s belt trick related to this model?    Is the “Quantum” unit based on twist cycles? \r\n\n-----------------------------------------------', 'Told yall, im a mechanic.', 'Im explained this before', ""There is no such thing as wave-particle duality and one should not teach this outdated concept any longer. Dirac expressed very clearly in the 1930s that quanta are a completely new kind of phenomenon that is neither particles nor waves. Particle like behavior of quantum systems is caused by weak measurements (Mott 1929) and wave like behavior is a classical ensemble average of single-quantum systems without energy gap. Beyond that quanta produce absolutely everything we can see around ourselves as emergent effects. Cream cheese is a quantum effect. So are cubes of tungsten and neutron stars and lederhosen.

In this case, we are given that f(x) = 10, and we need to find potential values of x.\n\nThe function is given by f(x) = 2 | x - 5 | - 8. We can set this equation equal to 10:\n\n2 | x - 5 | - 8 = 10\n\nNext, we isolate the absolute value term by moving the constant terms to the other side:\n\n2 | x - 5 | = 10 + 8\n2 | x - 5 | = 18\n\nNow, we can consider two cases: one where x - 5 is positive and another where it is negative.\n\nCase 1: x - 5 is positive (x - 5 ≥ 0)\nWhen x - 5 ≥ 0, the absolute value term simplifies to x - 5:\n\n2 (x - 5) = 18\n2x - 10 = 18\n2x = 18 + 10\n2x = 28\nx = 14\n\nSo, x = 14 is a potential value.\n\nCase 2: x - 5 is negative (x - 5 < 0)\nWhen x - 5 < 0, the absolute value term becomes -(x - 5) or -x + 5:\n\n2 (-x + 5) = 18\n-2x + 10 = 18\n-2x = 18 - 10\n-2x = 8\nx = -4\n\nTherefore, x = -4 is another potential value.\n\nIn summary, the possible values of x for which f(x) = 10 are x = 14 and x = -4.']"

Assuming that what she said was true then since the acceleration at the beginning is the same which is the change in velocity (or 2nd derivative of position) and the mass is the same then the pencil should go through. We all know that the pencil needs to gain velocity to go through but why is that. This is because the transfer of energy is actually what causes the damage not the force. You could use the equation, kinetic energy = (1/2) * mass * velocity squared. This would show you the energy and from there you could see how much energy the pencil had when it hit the wood. This would transfer to the wood and break it. So big energy = big transfer of energy = damage. You would fail physics if you think that the reason a pencil goes through in this example is just because of force.

But then you would be calculating the acceration of the pencil going through the wood and it would have the added mass the press.', 'Thanks sir', 'absolutely  goat', ""Guys is it really what we got asked in bsc physics?

529,o4H6adh7vmo,"['The simpler way is, to take the discount and subtract it from 100%, then multiply the cost, by what you got when you subtracted and just don’t forget to move your decimal in', ""I don't know if this will help anyone, but I made a formula for this: C = p - p(d/100), with C being the final cost, p being the initial price, and d being the discount. \n\nFor example: let's say you buy a 1250$ laptop on sale at 18% off. This means that C = 1250 - 1250(18/100), or C = 1250 - 1250(.18). 1250(.18) = 225, and 1250 - 225 = 1,025. The final price (C) is 1,025$.\n\n-\n\nAdditionally, this can be used the opposite way-- let's use the same example, saying you paid 1,025$ for the laptop at 18% off, but you don't remember the original price. \n\n1,025 = p - p(.18)   --> 1,025 = 1p - .18p    --> 1,025 = .82p\n\nNow isolate p (the original price) by dividing both sides by .82:    1,025/.82 = p     -->    p = 1,250\n\n-\n\nWe can even use this equation to find the discount percentage. Let's say you want to find what percentage of 1250 is equal to 225. \n\nWe know that 1250 is p (initial cost), and 225 is p(d/100). For the purpose of checking our work, we also know that the final cost (C) is equal to 1025. \n\nC = p - p(d/100)  —> 1025 = 1250 - 1250(d/100)\n\nWe know that 1250(d/100) = 225. \n\nWith that in mind, let's make a quick side equation:   \u2028   \u2028\n\n1250    d         = 225    —>        1250d         = 225                        \u2028   \n   1     100                                    100   \n\nLet's now isolate d by dividing both sides by 1250:   \n\n1250d / 100 = 225      —>     d / 100 = 225 / 1250     —>      d / 100 = 0.18      —>      d = 18\n\nNow that we know the discount (18 / 100 or .18), let's plug this back in to check our work. \n\n1025 = 1250 - 1250(.18)\n\u20281025 = 1250 - 225\u2028\n1025 = 1025   \n\nSo 225 is definitely 18% of 1250."", ""idk if you read this comment but why did you go straight to 1 %  in the last question of the video?

The author does not understand how it works. From collector towards base, C must go first, then R, not vice versa. Only this way the first RC couple will create any phase shift. Of course, then you do not need Cb. Ra constitutes a negative feedback from collector to base, so it can prevent oscillation if Ra/Rc is too small (100:1 should be OK). Ra parallel to Rb acts as R, so if you chose 100K||470K, R would be around 82K to roughly meet the formula (dynamic base resistance also plays a role in this). As for the bias: for BC549 and 2 mA collector current Vbe would be between 0.5 and 0.6 V. Ra and Rb acts as voltage divider, so for Ra:Rb = 1:4.7 as in this example the collector voltage would be almost equal to Vbe:  Vce = Vbe * ( Ra+Rb  / Rb). Therefore Vce would be 0.66 volt, pretty close to saturation. Author's claim the Vbe would be 7.42 volts is a complete bullshit - first, the source voltage for the Ra/Rb is not 9 volts, but Vce, second, if you put 7.4 volts hard to base-emitter junction, you would blow it because the base current would exceed the maximum allowed current by several orders of magnitude. If you want a decent working point, Ra should be at least 3 times the Rb (then you would get Vce = 1.5) but it can be as high as 7 times Rb - then you get Vce around 3-5 volts, about half the supply voltage. So in fact, swap Ra and Rb, make Ra = 470K and Rb = 100K, then you should get nicer sine wave without distortion caused by transistor saturation.\nBasically, you could replicate this circuit and it may even oscillate, but the author has no clue what he's talking about."", ""I would like this to use as a practice CW oscillator with a 9V battery and put a little speaker in the line to the collector.\nI think I'll still need a kind of a resistor in series with it ...."", ""The voltage in point B is determined by the transistor's base to emitter diode which is normally around 0.7 volts. we cannot use the voltage division of  RA and RB. the base-emitter diode creates a reference voltage at point B"", 'Nice job!

In my long  years of handling transistors, since 1956, I  have always been aware that the input impedance of a transistor is not symmetrical, in that for hard driven  common emitter NPN transistor the   input impedance is very low  for a positive going signala, while  it goes  higher for a negatively going signal, Obviously this distorts the signal, This is an interesting feature of   transistor and for the input impedance to  to be regarded as being constant one must operate the transistor over  small signal conditions or make it symmetrical by external circuitry using additional diodes. It is because of this that some oscillators as the super regenerative oscillator can quench itself with an RC circuit in either the base or the emitter.  Back in 1960 the germanium did not have such a high output impedance and in those days I found out   the reverse breakdown voltage of the emitter base junction which was about 14 volts for germanium and about 7 volts for silicon.  which was limiting my bistable oscillators.  I should have published that when I became conscious of it back in 1957. All my burnt transistors at the collector were used at  base emitter, either as  normal diodes or zener diodes, Yes, we were poor back then!. The Input impedance of the common collector is said to be high, but again when one looks deep into the asymmetry of the   emitter base junction,  the situation turns out to be a little more complex if one goes deep into the details. The darlington pair is very asymmetrical when it comes to its imput impedance, \nCongratulations for this set of videos it took me back to 1954 and a little earlier when I started using them early glass encapsulated one which had a thermal runway  and one needed to be careful, Thank you for uploading this video and the others,', 'shukran', 'sir can we connect 3 or more transistor', 'I enjoy watching your videos , thank you for offering such quality teaching', 'this is superb tomorrow is my exam so thanks', ""Really like you video's.

Not a single reply to my comment of over 12 months ago. \nHere is another discussion on the actual transfer of energy.   \n\nThis is the first time it has been covered.  All the explanations to date have glossed over the actual operation as no-one has taken the time to investigate how it works. \n\nWe will start by injecting a pulse of energy into the circuit. And then remove the item delivering the pulse. This energy is delivered until we know the capacitor has fully charged. \nWe will now take things very slowly:\nA little bit of the energy enters the capacitor where it is readily accepted and the voltage across the capacitor rises. \nBut the little bit of energy that is delivered to the coil (inductor) produces magnetic field the emanates from each of the turns of the coil and this expanding magnetic field cuts the other turns and induces a voltage into each turn that is opposite to the voltage you are applying and the result is a back voltage of 99.9% is produced by the coil and the coil does not accept any of the energy you are delivering. \nYou keep delivering energy and the capacitor accepts all the energy but the coil accepts NONE. Eventually the capacitor is fully charged and you stop delivering energy. \nThis condition exists because you have delivered the energy over a very short period of time. \nEnergy is a combination of voltage and current. \nThe capacitor now starts to deliver it energy to the coil. The inductor can only accept this energy very slowly and over a long period of time the capacitor delivers its energy to the coil and the coil produces magnetic flux. \nAs the capacitor voltage becomes less and less, the speed with which it delivers energy to the inductor get slower and slower and although the magnetic flux increases, the rate at which it increases get less and less and thus the back voltage produced by the coil becomes less. That is why the capacitor can keep delivering energy while its voltage is falling to near zero. \nFinally, when the capacitor voltage is zero, the inductor is producing maximum flux and the capacitor can no longer keep increasing the flux. \nIt is at this point that the flux starts to collapse and produce a voltage in the winding that is in the opposite direction to previously. This voltage emerges from the inductor and charges the capacitor.  But the capacitor can only accept a small amount of energy in this circuit and that's why the voltage across the capacitor increases very slowly. \nThe secret behind this part of the waveform is this:  The inductor is actually capable of delivering a much higher voltage than is recorded by a Cathode Ray Oscilloscope (that views the voltage waveform) and the capacitor is controlling the voltage that actually appears on the TANK CIRCUIT. \nThat is why the inductor is able to keep charging the capacitor to a high voltage, even when it is nearly out of flux. Even the last amount of flux will produce a high voltage and only when the flux has fully collapsed, does the capacitor start to deliver its energy to the inductor.  \n\nColin Mitchell\ntalking@tpg.com.au \nwww.talkingelectronics.com"", 'Nice one', ""Can you explain how tesla's hairpin circuit works?"", ""You are good at explaining the details, thank you very much.\nI would like to share something that's on topic in a practical way.\n\nYears ago I spent $200 on a radio scanner so I could listen to the aircraft frequencies.\nSome time after that I had an idea with the LC oscillator.\nI payed $4 for a cheap pocket transistor radio.\nI opened it up and found the coil of wire near the variable capacitor (the one with the tuning knob attached).\nUsing a small screwdriver I spread the coil apart a little which shifted the frequency of the oscillator\nto a range that included the aircraft frequencies.

Here's the full proof and the explanation.\n\nThe SPACE that surrounds us IS quantum gravitational (ON/IN BALANCE), AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Great.\n\nGravity/acceleration involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity; AS WHAT IS E=MC2 is taken directly from F=ma; AS “mass”/energy is CLEARLY electromagnetic/gravitational ON/IN BALANCE; AS TIME is NECESSARILY possible/potential AND actual ON/IN BALANCE. Great.\n\nTo answer the question: “What is nothing in accordance with physics (AND TIME)?”, we must understand (ON BALANCE) WHAT IS SOMETHING; AS BALANCE AND completeness go hand in hand. The ultimate unification and understanding of physics/physical experience (AND TIME) combines, BALANCES, AND INCLUDES opposites. Carefully consider what is THE EYE (ON BALANCE). Do notice the associated black “space” AND the dome AS WELL. NOW, carefully consider what follows !!!! The following proves what is the fourth dimension ON BALANCE.\n\nWHAT IS E=MC2 is the fundamental basis for the true understanding of what is inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE. TIME is NECESSARILY possible/potential AND actual ON/IN BALANCE, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is CLEARLY AND NECESSARILY proven to be gravity (ON/IN BALANCE). INDEED, consider TIME AND time dilation ON BALANCE !!!! (The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky ON BALANCE.) REGARDING WHAT IS E=MC2, c squared CLEARLY AND NECESSARILY represents a dimension of SPACE ON BALANCE. INDEED, consider what is THE EYE ON BALANCE; AS two AND three dimensional SPACE are, in fact, BALANCED !!!! Great. What is gravity is, ON BALANCE, an INTERACTION that cannot be shielded or blocked. Consider what is the ORANGE AND setting SUN. Notice what is the fully illuminated (AND WHITE) MOON. It is the same size as what is THE EYE. Notice what is the TRANSLUCENT AND BLUE sky. Indeed, consider complete combustion !!!! (I have mathematically proven the fourth dimension.) The density of what is pure WATER IS HALF of that of what is packed sand/wet packed sand. Now, WHAT IS THE EARTH IS ALSO BLUE !!!! The rotation of WHAT IS “THE MOON” matches the revolution, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is CLEARLY (AND NECESSARILY) proven to be gravity (ON/IN BALANCE) !!!! CLEARLY, gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy are linked (AND BALANCED) opposites (ON BALANCE); as the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. Consider TIME AND time dilation ON BALANCE. CLEARLY, ON BALANCE, I have solved WHAT IS the coronal heating “problem”. GREAT. (Indeed, consider what is lightning.)\n\nAbsolute SPACE IS the truly and fundamentally BALANCED inertial frame (or SPACE). Indeed, “mass”/ENERGY is CLEARLY electromagnetic/gravitational ON/IN BALANCE; AS c squared CLEARLY (AND NECESSARILY) represents a dimension of SPACE (ON BALANCE) REGARDING WHAT IS E=MC2. INDEED, consider TIME AND time dilation ON BALANCE; AS this proves what is the FOURTH dimension. Consider what is the man (AND THE EYE ON BALANCE) who IS standing on what is THE EARTH/ground. Great !!!! Think. The fourth dimension AND WHAT IS E=MC2 are FUNDAMENTALLY consistent with/AS what are wave/particle duality AND the fact that c squared CLEARLY (AND NECESSARILY) represents a dimension of SPACE ON BALANCE (REGARDING WHAT IS E=MC2) !!!! CLEARLY (ON BALANCE), gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy are linked AND BALANCED opposites; as the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky ON BALANCE !!!!

Now, entering the magnet, the current flows towards the negative side of the battery. A magnet has a toroidal field. The North pole of any magnet has a centrifugal divergent magnetic field clockwise (discharge direction). Therefore, the current will spiral upwards in a clockwise manner and induce a torque on the wire to make it spin in the same direction.

Using this result, subtract your original number chosen in Step 1 from it\n*** Answer is always 3\n\nTo enhance the trick and amaze your friends, do the following:\nStep 6A.  Since you know at this point the answer your friend has is 3, you can manipulate the trick about any way you want to and always tell your friend the resulting answer.  \n\nStep 6B.  For instance, since after Step 5, the answer your friend gets is always 3, make up some number and tell your friend to add it to his result.  For instance, tell him to add 7.\n*** Answer now is 10\n\n***  Summary #1:  as long as you can can keep up with the math you\'ve instructed your friend to do, again, after Step 5 above and knowing your friend\'s result is Always 3, you could tell your friend to add 12 (Answer now is 15) or tell him to subtract 3 (Answer now is 0) or tell the friend to add 346 (Answer now is 349).  Of course you could tell the friend to multiple his result from Step 5 by 4 for the new Answer of 12.  Your creativeness and own ability to do the math in your head after Step 5 will allow you to do countless versions of this trick.\n\n***  Fun Note:  Applying the exact same logic as explained in Summary #1 above, you can modify the two tricks in the video similarly since you always know the final resulting answer!  Try it out.\n \n***  The mathematical equation for the basic trick of Steps 1 through 5 is:\r\n[(2x+6) / 2] - x = 3\r\nWhere X is is the number your friend chooses in Step 1.   \n\nBTW, I was taught this trick way back in about 1972 when I was in 4th grade and have done the ""trick"" thousands of times with all kinds of wild / imaginative modifications as explained in Summary #1 above.\n\nEnjoy!', 'Yeap it is 7', 'How did you do that?', 'Tf']"

Momentum serves as the initial cause of pushing and pulling.  The energy, emanating from the internal core of a planet, is what gives rise to momentum, commonly referred to as gravity, and not due to the planet’s size, mass, or space-time curvature.  For example, when energy is applied, it generates the necessary momentum for the actions of pushing and pulling.  Without the application of energy, momentum cannot be established.  Consequently, force cannot be exerted for pushing and pulling, as it lacks a physical existence.

The other said ""yes, it is well know that this particular integral has been unsolved for centuries."" So the first professor of mathematics says ""well, what if we play a game- I\'ve got some dice here, and we can use them to find the solution. The second math professor says ""how will that work?"" to which the first replied ""well, there are six sides to a die, so if we make 1 the sine function, 2 the cosine function, and so on then we will have the six trig functions all together."" ""Quite so!"" said the second, ""so then with a pair of dice there would be 90 different ways to add, subtract, multiply, or divide two trig functions at a time to see if that would create a new function that could then be integratable."" Verily thus"" said the first, ""let us begin."" And so they did! Rolling the dice once would decide the two trig functions, and then they created a four sided die from a failing student\'s test to decide if they would add, subtract, multiply, or divide them, and then they would flip a coin to decide the order they would subtract or divide if necessary. The night drudged on, to no avail, until the second professor was about to call it a night... ""Wait!"" said the first, ""perhaps the key lies in the origin of the secant- the mathematician Eratosthenes discovered the secant only once he started to go bling in his later years, thus the name \'see\' \'cant\' you see? so the solution is simple: we must integrate blindfolded."" The second mathematician obviously thought the first was crazy, but as the second was packing up to leave the first had already made a makeshift blindfold and was attempting to solve the integral. Since the first mathematician looked so foolish and yet so determined at the same time, the second took pity and quietly performed the calculations from the dice that the first could not see from his rolls. This, of course, worked. Hence the second professor screamed ""eureka!"" and scared the first professor straight off his seat in shock, and the integral of secant was finally solved. \n\nSo you see, this is the reason why we must multiply the top and the bottom by secant plus tangent.', 'I got that confusion too. becouse sec(x) =sec X tan  not sec + tan', 'Thanks alot💜', 'Life saver!!!']"

Begin by creating a chamber with specific engineering to contain a quantum fluid possessing unique properties. Ensure that this fluid can exhibit quantum behavior on a macroscopic scale due to advanced manipulation techniques.\r\nIntroduce a single electron into the chamber, suspending it within the quantum fluid. Allow the electron to move through the fluid, facilitating its interaction with the fluid\'s molecules in a manner that leads to novel behaviors.\r\nObserve how the quantum fluid responds to the electron\'s presence. Expect the fluid to exhibit behaviors that appear to bridge the gap between the principles of quantum mechanics and those of macroscopic physics.\r\nPay special attention to a remarkable outcome: the emergence of a phenomenon akin to ""quantum cavitation."" This phenomenon occurs when the electron attains a specific velocity or energy state, triggering the localized evaporation of the quantum fluid. This evaporation process results in the creation of minuscule cavities filled with vapor.\r\nNote that these vapor-filled cavities, despite their size, possess quantum properties of their own. Recognize that the electron\'s wave function extends into these cavities.\r\nObserve the subsequent formation and collapse of these microscopic cavities. Acknowledge that this process generates microscopic shockwaves and disturbances within the quantum fluid, and that these disturbances manifest as both particle-like and wave-like phenomena concurrently.

Assume, the magnitude of the uniform magnetic field is increasing.\nThe flux is BA, where B is the magnetic field and A the area enclosing it, and the rate of change of the flux is due in part to the change in the magnetic field, and in part to the change in the area enclosed by the changing path.\nThe resistor will heat up! \nThe equation of the rate of change of flux....without the details of the derivation are\n= (dB/dt) A\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 +\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0BLv (Change of B, fixed path)\xa0\xa0 (Change of path)\nThe calculation is a bit mysterious.

How? A lower pressure means the velocity of the air over the roof top must increase. Bernoulli\'s principle does not say ""when the velocity is high, the pressure is low"" and vice versa. Bernoulli\'s principle says when the velocity of an airflow changes, the static pressure changes in accordance with Bernoulli\'s equation. Therefore, you cannot use Bernoulli\'s equation to compare the airflow outside and inside a house with walls. You must compare the velocity of the air ahead of the house with the velocity of the air over the roof. With a flat roof, the lifting force will be very low.\n\nIn example 2, you describe lift in accorance with the ""equal transit"" hypothesis. Sadly, this idea is taught to student pilots all over the world, but it is not correct. Think about it: How can an air molecule that was separated from another air molecule by the wing know when the other air molecule will reach the trailing edge of the wing? Wind tunnel tests show that the air flowing over the wing reaches the trailing edge before the air flowing under the wing. If you search for ""Prof. Holger Babinsky"" and ""Lift"" you will see how it works. \nYour drawing shows a wing with a flat undersurface and zero angle of attack. Therefore, the velocity of the air under the wing will have the same as the velocity of the airplane, and the static air pressure under the wing is the same as the static pressure in the atmosphere. To get a higher static pressure under the wing, the wing must meet the airflow with an angle, called the angle of attack. And don\'t forget when a wing produces lift, it deflects air downwards in accordance with Newton\'t third law of motion.\n\nFor a better understanding of Bernoulli\'s equation, I recommend the channel of The Efficient Engineer.', 'There is an equation called ""Lift Force Equation"" and in that equation, there is no velocity differential. Instead, there is only one velocity, which is aircraft velocity. Why are they ignoring V2-V1 and write only V ? Additionally, we know that lift force increases as aircraft speed increases. How can I understand it through this equation you wrote? V2 will increase to the same extend V1 does. Doesn\'t it?', 'Sir i have a doubt , that we can use Bernoulli theorem in any point of a single streamline\nBut you used Bernoulli equation in two different streamline. Why??', 'thank you good sir this actually helped a bunch', 'The authors have two wrong scientific approaches: researching the creation of Lift force and Low pressure at upper side of the wing, relative to the ground surface and Earth. I explain the aerodynamic cavitation and existence of Lee side aerocavern, and creation of Aerodynamic force. Low pressure creates force normal to the cord (contact surface), and it name is ""aerodynamic force"" because is made from the air (aero) in motion (dynamic), or wind relative to the wing (object).', 'Why it takes me so long to find this YouTube Channel...

Now, I am assuming, of course, that it doesn't, but I'm not sure why.  If I put a butterfly valve on a pipe, I can regulate the volume flow in the pipe.

However, it actually finds the derivative with respect to x of x to the LTE of order two.  Except at the point x = 2, these are not equivalent. \n\nIn the context of ordinary numbers, a number or function raised to a power is annotated universally by placing the power above and to the right of the number or function.\n\nFor example, the b-th power of a is written with b above and to the right of a.  In like manner, the c-th power of the b-th power of a is written with c placed above and to the right of the notation for the b-th power of a.  This gives rise to an open (no parentheses) leaning tower, or LTE, consisting of the sequence a, b and c.  In in-line notation, this is written as a^b^c, where the circumflex ^ represents exponentiation.\n\nParentheses can be added to make the implied order of exponentiation explicit.  Viz, a^b^c = ((a^b)^c)  and  a^b^c^d = (((a^b)^c)^d).  So, if a, b, c and d all equal x, then x^x^x = ((x^x)^x)  and  x^x^x^x = (((x^x)^x)^x). \n\nWith a, b and c all equal to x, this video finds the derivative with respect to x of a^b^c = (a^(b^c)) = x^x^x = (x^(x^x)) and not of a^b^c = x^x^x = ((a^b)^c) = ((x^x)^x).  In the former case, ln (x^(x^x)) = (x^x) ln x, whereas, in the latter case, ln ((x^x)^x) = x ln (x^x).  The former follows from the non-standard interpretation assumed in the video and the latter follows from the standard interpretation of exponentiation.  See equation ln y = ln (x^(x^x)) = (x^x) ln x, the equation completed at 1:13 into the video.\n\nWhen a, b, and c, etc., are all equal to, say, x, then x^x^x is referred to as the third tetration of x.  Likewise, x^x^x^x is referred to as the fourth tetration of x.  I suggest the in-line notations ^3x, ^4x and ^nx for the third, fourth and n-th tetrations of x, respectively, though parentheses may be required to disambiguate the application of the specified exponent to the right, as in these examples, from application of the exponent to the left as in the application of the exponent ^b to the left in a^b = ""a to the power b"".\n\nConsistent with the interpretation of x^x^x employed in the video, x^x^x^x is interpreted as x^(x^x^x), and, consequently, ln x^x^x^x equals (x^x^x) ln x, where the factor preceding ln x comes from the final three factors of x^x^x^x and not from the first three factors of x^x^x^x.  Since, from the first sentence in the second previous paragraph above, x^x^x = x^(x^x), substitution yields x^x^x^x = x^(x^x^x) = x^(x^(x^x)) in the interpretation of the video, which interpretation is not consistent with the universally standard way of representing and interpreting exponentiation of exponentiations.\n\nNote from the fourth previous paragraph that the standard interpretation of exponentiation expressed in in-line notation reads x^x^x^x = (((x^x)^x)^x), whereas in the non-standard interpretation used in the video x^x^x^x = (x^(x^(x^x))).  One sees that the pattern of nested parentheses proceeds from the left and outward in the standard interpretation of exponentiation, and from the right-and outward in the non-standard interpretation employed by the video.  These patterns extend in the obvious way to LTE’s of higher order and, of course, to tetrations of higher order.\n\nWhen the proposed tetration notation is used to express and compare the standard and non-standard interpretations of exponentiation, one finds, for example, that\n\n        x^x^x = ^3x = (^2x)^x     (standard)\n        x^x^x = ^3x = x^(^2x)     (non-standard)\n\n        x^x^x^x = ^4x = ((^2x)^x)^x     (standard)\n        x^x^x^x = ^4x = x^(x^(^2x))     (non-standard)\n\n        x^x^x^x^x = ^5x = (((^2x)^x)^x)^x     standard)\n        x^x^x^x^x = ^5x = x^(x^(x^(^2x)))     (non-standard)\n\nThe pattern trends evident above extend in the obvious way to tetrations of arbitrary integer order.\n\nOne sees that the in-line representations of the two interpretations are mirrors of each other.  For any positive integer n, the two interpretations of the tetration ^nx are inequivalent except when x = 2.', 'anyone else just do derivative x^x^x^x^x after this just for the hell of it? 🥴', 'What will be the general formula for the derivative of x^x^x^x ..... upto N times where N is any integer ( not an infinity ) ?\n\nIf you will tell, then I will consider you as an intelligent person ....... perhaps even now you may be intelligent .........', 'how about y=x^x^y', 'Are you certain that your final result is correct?

The nucleus is also called a DEUTERON.\n\nThere are deuterons in every atom (except hydrogen).\nThe proton is paired with a neutron in every atom after hydrogen.  Some larger atoms also have extra neutrons, but all have at least one neutron for every proton.\n\nSomething in the proton pairs with a neutron and is repeated over and over again in the nucleus.\n\nWithout this proton neutron bond, neutrons would all decay in about 15 minutes.  The binding energy of the deuteron prevents the decay of the neutron. If neutrons weren\'t able to keep stable within a deuteron, they would have decayed away.  If this had happened, the formation of elements would have been impossible.\n\nThis proton neutron bond is the key to building elements.  \nSomething in the proton neutron pairs, is key to everything that is, except simple hydrogen.\n\nNext, Helium has two protons and two neutrons, or two deuterons.\nHelium is very stable.  So do sets of two pairs in the nucleus make other common elements?\n\nYES. The most common elements in the universe have the multiple sets of the two deuteron configuration:\nThey include, : helium 2 deuterons, carbon 6, oxygen 8, neon 10, magnesium 12, silicon 14. \n\nA key reaction in the early universe was the collision of a proton and neutron to form a deuteron, or deuterium nucleus.  \nIn order to form a nucleus a proton and neutron must collide and stick.  This was the key reaction in element building.\n\nDeuterium forms stronger chemical bonds than hydrogen.\nDeuterium enters all chemical reactions that hydrogen does but reacts more slowly.\n\n""By studying the deuteron, the simplest nucleus in nature, scientists gain understanding of more complex atomic nuclei that make essentially all visible matter in the universe - energy, gov.', 'thank you for your great explanation. it helps me a lot to understand the atomic number and atomic mass.', '🎉\nThis is simple and educative', ""Could NEUTRONS be HYDROGEN ATOMS?  \n\nFirst Thoughts\n\nThe mass of a neutron and an hydrogen atom are the same.\nHydrogen atom is 1.008 amu  (atomic mass unit).\nNeutron is 1.008 amu.  ( Proton 1.007, and Electron .0005)\n\nThe hydrogen atom is made of a proton and an electron.\nMy suggestion is that a neutron is made of a proton and an electron too.\nBeta Decay is where a neutron transforms into a proton, electron, and anti neutrino. \nElectron Capture is when an electron pulled into a nucleus combines with a proton to make a neutron, plus a neutrino.\nHydrogen plasma is hydrogen where the protons and electrons are separated.\n\nMy next suggestion is that in a nucleus every proton from helium on, is paired with at least one neutron. My suggestion that this is because protons that have charge are separated by the neutrons so that they won't repel each other.  The neutron has no charge. Note some atoms have extra neutrons. \n\nThere may also be some force that pairs each neutron to a proton in the nucleus making a more stable form. Deuterium, an isotope of hydrogen has one neutron paired with one proton in its nucleus. Deuterium forms stronger chemical bonds than hydrogen. \n\nNow substitute the words deuterium nucleus for any neutron paired with a proton, and you discover that the nucleus of all elements has earmarks of deuterium in every neutron and proton pair. \n\nFurther, where there are two such neutron proton pairs, there are earmarks of helium nucleus with its two neutrons and two protons in its nucleus.\n\nFinally those elements with two such  neutron proton pairs, like that found in helium atoms, are notable.  The most common elements in the universe often have this configuration.\nHelium 2 neutron proton pairs, Carbon 6 pairs, Oxygen 8, Neon 10, Magnesium 12, Silicon 14.\n***\n\nRevised Thoughts\n\nThe comments I've received about my premise asking if a neutron and a hydrogen atom are the same, have suggested some needed adjustments. \n\nBoth the neutron and hydrogen atom have the same atomic mass units. Both are, in my model, made up of one proton and one electron. But there are differences between the two.\n\nFor example when it comes to stability - a free neutron decays after 10 + minutes into a proton, electron and antineutrino; but an hydrogen atom does not.  Though in the extreme heat of hydrogen plasma, the proton and electron are separated. This and other reasons suggest some fundamental difference between a neutron and a hydrogen atom.\n\nSo what is it ? The proton is the same in both, so I rule that out.  That leaves the only thing left,  the electron. \n\nMy suggestion then, is that while a hydrogen atom has a single electron in a shell outside the nucleus; the neutron has that electron within. That means the neutron, unlike the hydrogen atom, is a proton plus electron condensed together in a single composite .\nThis resolves many concerns that I've gotten.\n\n\nThe DRAWING shows my models for the nucleus of these elements\nHelium, and carbon. \nNH  = Neutron - Hydrogen, P = Proton, E = electron. Note how the neutral charged neutrons keep the protons apart. Yet at the same time each neutron pairs with a proton.\n\nSUMMARY; if this is true, we see an atom in a new way.  The neutron that was seen as a sidekick in the nucleus, now becomes the star and center stage as a different form of hydrogen atom. Paired  neutrons and protons are added to the nucleus, to get the rest of the elements. Somehow every neutron is loosely paired to one proton.\n\nThen too we see that every nucleus after hydrogen itself, has at least one neutron paired with every proton or a deuterium like configuration inside the nucleus.  \n\nNext we see that some of the most common elements have two or more paired neutrons and  protons, or a helium like configurations inside the nucleus.\nThe neutron is the key to the nucleus.\n\nThen go a step further and reexamine the start of the universe.\nStart with a Singularity of photons that are outside space time.\nThe Big Bang out of that singularity created electrons, protons and their anti matter versions in pair conversion.\nThe electrons and protons form neutrons  a form of hydrogen atoms.\nThe neutron pairs with left over protons and electrons to make all the elements."", 'So so easy, and effortless understanding, thanks 😊 so much']"

Here's the full proof and the explanation.\n\nThe SPACE that surrounds us IS quantum gravitational (ON/IN BALANCE), AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Great.\n\nGravity/acceleration involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity; AS WHAT IS E=MC2 is taken directly from F=ma; AS “mass”/energy is CLEARLY electromagnetic/gravitational ON/IN BALANCE; AS TIME is NECESSARILY possible/potential AND actual ON/IN BALANCE. Great.\n\nTo answer the question: “What is nothing in accordance with physics (AND TIME)?”, we must understand (ON BALANCE) WHAT IS SOMETHING; AS BALANCE AND completeness go hand in hand. The ultimate unification and understanding of physics/physical experience (AND TIME) combines, BALANCES, AND INCLUDES opposites. Carefully consider what is THE EYE (ON BALANCE). Do notice the associated black “space” AND the dome AS WELL. NOW, carefully consider what follows !!!! The following proves what is the fourth dimension ON BALANCE.\n\nWHAT IS E=MC2 is the fundamental basis for the true understanding of what is inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE. TIME is NECESSARILY possible/potential AND actual ON/IN BALANCE, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is CLEARLY AND NECESSARILY proven to be gravity (ON/IN BALANCE). INDEED, consider TIME AND time dilation ON BALANCE !!!! (The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky ON BALANCE.) REGARDING WHAT IS E=MC2, c squared CLEARLY AND NECESSARILY represents a dimension of SPACE ON BALANCE. INDEED, consider what is THE EYE ON BALANCE; AS two AND three dimensional SPACE are, in fact, BALANCED !!!! Great. What is gravity is, ON BALANCE, an INTERACTION that cannot be shielded or blocked. Consider what is the ORANGE AND setting SUN. Notice what is the fully illuminated (AND WHITE) MOON. It is the same size as what is THE EYE. Notice what is the TRANSLUCENT AND BLUE sky. Indeed, consider complete combustion !!!! (I have mathematically proven the fourth dimension.) The density of what is pure WATER IS HALF of that of what is packed sand/wet packed sand. Now, WHAT IS THE EARTH IS ALSO BLUE !!!! The rotation of WHAT IS “THE MOON” matches the revolution, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is CLEARLY (AND NECESSARILY) proven to be gravity (ON/IN BALANCE) !!!! CLEARLY, gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy are linked (AND BALANCED) opposites (ON BALANCE); as the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. Consider TIME AND time dilation ON BALANCE. CLEARLY, ON BALANCE, I have solved WHAT IS the coronal heating “problem”. GREAT. (Indeed, consider what is lightning.)\n\nAbsolute SPACE IS the truly and fundamentally BALANCED inertial frame (or SPACE). Indeed, “mass”/ENERGY is CLEARLY electromagnetic/gravitational ON/IN BALANCE; AS c squared CLEARLY (AND NECESSARILY) represents a dimension of SPACE (ON BALANCE) REGARDING WHAT IS E=MC2. INDEED, consider TIME AND time dilation ON BALANCE; AS this proves what is the FOURTH dimension. Consider what is the man (AND THE EYE ON BALANCE) who IS standing on what is THE EARTH/ground. Great !!!! Think. The fourth dimension AND WHAT IS E=MC2 are FUNDAMENTALLY consistent with/AS what are wave/particle duality AND the fact that c squared CLEARLY (AND NECESSARILY) represents a dimension of SPACE ON BALANCE (REGARDING WHAT IS E=MC2) !!!! CLEARLY (ON BALANCE), gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy are linked AND BALANCED opposites; as the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky ON BALANCE !!!! INDEED, consider TIME AND time dilation ON BALANCE; AS “mass”/ENERGY is (CLEARLY) electromagnetic/gravitational ON/IN BALANCE; AS TIME is NECESSARILY possible/potential AND actual ON/IN BALANCE; AS the rotation of WHAT IS THE MOON matches the revolution; AS WHAT IS E=MC2 is taken directly from F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is CLEARLY (AND NECESSARILY) proven to be gravity (ON/IN BALANCE) !!!!

Great. It is proven. Finally, ON BALANCE, notice WHAT IS the TRANSLUCENT AND BLUE sky. Magnificent !!!! Think. It all CLEARLY makes perfect sense ON BALANCE !!!! Notice WHAT IS “THE MOON” (ON BALANCE) !!!! THINK !!!! ABSOLUTELY MAGNIFICENT !!!! CONSIDER TIME AND TIME DILATION ON BALANCE !!!! GREAT !!!! AGAIN, do notice WHAT IS the ORANGE “SUN” ON BALANCE !!!!
