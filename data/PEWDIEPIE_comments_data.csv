She saw the recipe written in a heavy cream package and it's little bit different from what Pewds made. \nIt's just heavy cream, bananas, ham, cheese slices, salt and nutmeg. You roll the bananas with chesse and then the ham and pour the heavy cream, add salt and the nutmeg to your liking and bake it. And there you have it!"", 'i dont want this', 'This was torture to watch.  Not how to cook at all 🤣!  This recipe is horrid.  Who came up with this terrible idea?  It’s like watching a horror film.  If you cook enough, you start to figure out what pairings of food work and don’t work in a recipe.  Too many conflicting flavor components in this recipe that it’s risky serving this dish to anyone without throwing up.  \n\nThe one skill you should learn how to do, after watching this video, is how to make a hollandaise sauce.  Never put water in a hollandaise sauce!  Use a large glass bowl to whisk the egg yolks, butter and real lemon juice (if you want), and do this over boiling water in a pot.  The boiling water will cook the eggs because it’ll steam from having the bowl on top of the pot.  It’ll also help melt the butter into the eggs.  The lemon juice is for added flavor.  Make sure to whisk vigorously until the eggs become thick like a sauce and don’t separate.  You’ll know it’s the right consistency if you get a spoon and test the sauce on the spoon.  If it stays on the spoon and wipes a clean line with your finger then it’s cooked perfectly.  At this point it’s a choice to add lemon zest or not to the sauce. \n\nIf the bananas are going in the oven don’t put lemon on them!  It’s disgusting.  Messes with the flavor and caramelization of the bananas.  And never use a squirt bottle of lemon juice.  It’s not real lemon 😬 It tastes horrible compared to real lemon.  Cooking tip 101, always use the real fruit in cooking any dish.  If you can’t find the fruit in season, then don’t make the dish and fine something else to make.  Always use fresh ingredients to elevate the flavors of your dishes and it’ll be healthier to eat.', '“It smells awful”-says the person who added an energy drink to eggs and butter', 'Edgar is the cutest lil dude I’ve ever seen.', 'These new YouTube ads are pure cancer.

There\'s a few reasons why people are getting tilted about Anisa even to this day, with creator clash etc. 1st of all in Ian\'s original video about this whole mess you could see he was indeed actually upset, just look at how red his face gets by the end of the video. He is NOT okay with her doing OF despite what he says, especially with the extra context we have now you can see how much he\'s become a shell of a man compared to his old self. Secondly most of the ""hate"" is directed at Anisa because she is indeed a horrible person. She is a serial cheater, embarrasses Ian every chance she gets like when they go on podcasts. She even speaks for him like he\'s a battered wife from the 1960s. She is constantly thirsting after other youtubers like ChrisRayGun and she was even trying to hook up with leafy! It\'s all publicly available on her twitter. I and many others think that\'s why he did a Content Cop video on leafy was because A) He was really mad about Anisa thirsting after leafy or B) Anisa was mad Leafy ignored her so she gave Ian the order to do the video on him.\n\nI\'ve had a few mates who ended up in abusive relationships and one thing I\'ll say is they all usually follow a similar pattern. For Ian & Anisa the signs are all there. Most people didn\'t want to see Ian get sucked into the abyss because he was a great entertainer who had the potential to go all the way but instead he chose getting some BPD poontang over his career and health. Once she sucks him dry (which is due to happen any day now) she\'ll move on and Ian will be a broken man. Maybe one day he\'ll come back and people will give him a second chance but he\'s burned so many bridges that I doubt he\'ll ever have the same impact again.

Grass is usually the color green. Grasses are monocotyledon herbaceous plants.\r\n\r\nThe grasses include the ""grass"" of the family Poaceae. This family is also called Gramineae. The family also include some of the sedges (Cyperaceae) and the rushes (Juncaceae).[1] These three families are not closely related but all of them belong to clades in the order Poales. They are similar adaptations to a common life-style.\r\n\r\nThe true grasses include cereals, bamboo and the grasses of lawns (turf) and grassland. Uses for graminoids include food (as grain, sprouted grain, shoots or rhizomes), drink (beer, whisky), pasture for livestock, thatching thatch, paper, fuel, clothing, insulation, construction, sports turf, basket weaving and many others.\r\n\r\nMany grasses are short, but some grasses can grow tall, such as bamboo. Plants from the grass family can grow in many places and make grasslands, including areas which are very arid or cold. There are several other plants that look similar to grass and are referred to as such, but are not members of the grass family. These plants include rushes, reeds, papyrus and water chestnut. Seagrass is a monocot in the order Alismatales.\r\n\r\nGrasses are an important food for many animals, such as deer, buffalo, cattle, mice, grasshoppers, caterpillars and many other grazers. Unlike other plants, grasses grow from the bottom, so when animals eat grass they usually do not destroy the part that grows.[2] This is a part of why the plants are successful. Without grass, soil may wash away into rivers (erosion).', 'this monecraft is just unplayable', 'Do not try to change my decision after being slaughtered and strung along to be slaughtered again and again', 'I refuse to like or love any thing or one.', 'I hate everyone.', 'Man its so weird seeing these videos after he retired and now his child is on the way', 'Filt kinfe trash sh*', 'Lions are just tigers with good barbers', 'ohio craft:', 'This mod is such garbage.

The signatories include delegates from New Hampshire, Massachusetts Bay, Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. The declaration became one of the most circulated and widely reprinted documents in early American history.\n\nThe Committee of Five drafted the declaration to be ready when Congress voted on independence. John Adams, a leading proponent of independence, persuaded the Committee of Five to charge Thomas Jefferson with writing the document\'s original draft, which the Second Continental Congress then edited. The declaration was a formal explanation of why the Continental Congress voted to declare American independence from the Kingdom of Great Britain, a year after the American Revolutionary War began in April 1775. The Lee Resolution for independence was passed unanimously by the Congress on July 2, 1776.\n\nAfter ratifying the text on July 4, Congress issued the Declaration of Independence in several forms. It was initially published as the printed Dunlap broadside that was widely distributed and read to the public. Jefferson\'s original draft is currently preserved at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., complete with changes made by Adams and Benjamin Franklin, and Jefferson\'s notes of changes made by Congress. The best-known version of the Declaration is the signed copy now displayed at the National Archives in Washington, D.C., which is popularly regarded as the official document. This copy, engrossed by Timothy Matlack, was ordered by Congress on July 19 and signed primarily on August 2, 1776.[2][3]\n\nThe declaration justified the independence of the United States by listing 27 colonial grievances against King George III and by asserting certain natural and legal rights, including a right of revolution. Its original purpose was to announce independence, and references to the text of the declaration were few in the following years. Abraham Lincoln made it the centerpiece of his policies and his rhetoric, as in the Gettysburg Address of 1863.[4] Since then, it has become a well-known statement on human rights, particularly its second sentence: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."" Stephen Lucas called it ""one of the best-known sentences in the English language"",[5] with historian Joseph Ellis writing that the document contains ""the most potent and consequential words in American history"".[6] The passage came to represent a moral standard to which the United States should strive. This view was notably promoted by Lincoln, who considered the Declaration to be the foundation of his political philosophy and argued that it is a statement of principles through which the United States Constitution should be interpreted.[7]:\u200a126\u200a\n\nThe Declaration of Independence inspired many similar documents in other countries, the first being the 1789 Declaration of United Belgian States issued during the Brabant Revolution in the Austrian Netherlands. It also served as t.Declaration of Independence', 'ECNEDNEPEDNI FO NOITARALCED EHT\n\nP.S. I already liked and subscribed, can I be entered into the giveaway']"

Siblings do share DNA with each other, and identical twins have, I believe, the exact same DNA (or almost exact anyway), so they are pretty close to being clones of each other, but they did not create each other, their parents did.\n\nSo in other words:\nIf you create your own clone, the clone is your child.\nIf someone else creates your clone, the clone is your sibling.\nThat\'s my belief/headcanon, anyway.', ""I'm pretty sure the red larva represents the Woman's heart, which she locked away cause she thought it was stupid.

We the people are in control not them. Tim Allen and Donald Trump are the underdogs of this revolution. May there names be remembered in full uncensored truth. They both are American hero's at there finest. Don't believe the news. It's all fake. This is the revolution of the last man standing. If females want more rights they are going to have to work just as hard as everyone else instead of hating us so much. Both male and females have to work together no matter what. I hate them always playing the victim and capitalising on such a concept because that is corruption and it's taking advantage of emotions to take money from people and only benefits huge companies. Modern society has truly confused as all and that needs to stop right here and now. One day I shall  be remembered as that man who took a stand and changed the course of history and never gave up even when people say I am crazy. Either we can figure this out or we all will parish because of such conflicts. I will keep smiling even if I am weird because I don't care. I mix fantasy with reality with no problem and still can talk to girls just fine. What I don't like is when they think they know everything and try to act like a smart ass and play the weak victim. I have had enough of that. Females need cut that off right now. If you don't agree then get out of my way. I stand by strong willed female leaders who were the early founders in early 1900s. Now a days it's just trash. The founders of Female rights were strong and had fire. And  now it's just being forced to the point of full blown corruption. The early Female rights leaders had a strong determined reason for it and were not driven by greed. Susan B Anthony was a true strong leader for Female rights and now we don't have such power like that anymore and it's being driven by complete fools. The rights they are wanting seem very silly. Do you want to change your DNA to be more male perhaps and be both male and female. You females are asking for stuff that is not possible now when back then it made more since. What happened is what I want to know. Are you denying what true human nature is suppose to be?"", 'This is just like Dark Souls', 'Dat scheiße at 2:19 xDDD']"

When Kibiki and the cameraman went there, she was already there, and possessed, completely or nearly completely succumbed to it. \nShe killed Kibiki, then the spirit killed her after.

3828,bbjQxExli6Q,"[""Back when pewdiepie actually did let's plays"", ""I've always had a difficult time working out a clinical explanation for what exactly Johnny wanted from his relationship with River, and why it's considered so disturbing by everyone else.  Whenever I make sense of it, it really doesn't come off as that bad.  Nonetheless, here's my best approach:\n\nThe reason Johnny grew interested in River in the first place was because of her lack of social homogeneity.  Her personality and idiosyncrasies made her stand out more than other people, making her more identifiable in social gatherings.  Johnny, on the other hand, had a normal personality and no real idiosyncrasies, making him less identifiable in social gatherings.  This frustrated him.  He envied River, and he hoped that a relationship with her would cause him to stand out more.\n\nThe reason this is seen as disturbing is because it violates social norms towards relationships.  And the reason it violates social norms with relationships is because if you seek out a romantic relationship with someone in the hopes that you can use it as a tool for social clout, then it's less likely that you will actually end up wanting what's best for the other person.\n\nBut I still have a difficult time comprehending this.  I think it's fine for Johnny to be interested in River because of her weirdness.  In fact, I actually find it extremely sweet.  He was attracted to her personality even when it caused everyone else to stay away from her.  If he hoped that being with her meant that he would also be seen as weird, then I don't really see that as a big deal.  At the end of the day, he still grew attached to her and cared deeply for her.  He still did things solely to make her happy, because he loved her.\n\nAnd there are other selfish motivations people have for going into relationships all the time, and they're never seen as disturbing or cold.  Some people seek out relationships because they're lonely, and hope that being with someone will erase some of that loneliness.  Some people seek out relationships because they're horny and want to have sex with someone.  Some people seek out relationships because they're after the heart-fluttering feeling of being in love and desperately want it to be fulfilled.  I see no reason to believe that these selfish motivations are any better than the selfish motivation Johnny had."", 'Day 12 of commenting on every single one of pewds videos.

Symptoms for such includes: impulsive & obsessive behaviors, which explains her love for light houses (specifically Anya as she worries the poor building will feel lonely without anyone near) and, later on, her constant origami folding. The origami is in the shape of a rabbit, which plays a major part in John's reasoning for wanting to go to the moon in the first place, but of course, you'll find this out soon.  It is also true that some forms of autism lead to difficulty in social interactions and the development of empathy, or understanding other people's emotions.  Along with a few of the terms I picked out from previous videos that are generally used by people with autism, this guess is fairly solid.""]"

It's a shame the project never finished because I built some maps that I am proud of even today. I made an entire village that you were supposed to explore as the player, there was a mansion, a church, a school, convenience store and some homes. Small detail but in the actual mod most of the windows were transparent so you could see the village outside as you explored the maps. This demo was more of a proof of concept which is why it's quite incoherent but the idea of the creator was to have a similar feeling as the Amnesia game by making the player uneasy instead of bombarding him or her with monsters. Another little detail, the loud demon scream in the convenience store is, if I remember correctly, taken from the bedroom scene in Paranormal Activity. \nThe demo is a bit rough though, for example the map outside the starting house is broken, the skybox is missing and some assets including the roof of the houses are missing.
