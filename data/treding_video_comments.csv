Unfortunately, I find this song to just be a boring, melancholy pop song with little value to those that aren't huge Beatles fans. I seem to be in the minority on this and I'm sure I will be downvoted to hell for my opinion. Seeing all the praise on multiple channels and almost no one having the same opinion as me, I felt like I was the only one that didn't care for it. The song really isn't bad or anything, it's just not for me. However, the video for the song is objectively terrible. No idea what they were thinking putting that nonsensical mess together. Lastly, I am happy for the fans that this means something to. I wouldn't deny others something they hold dear and enjoy."", 'On it’s own, it’s sort of what I expected, but I think if you listen to it, with the visuals of Peter Jackson’s video, the whole is definitely more than the sum of its parts.

And to those who say it was never intended to be a Beatles song - who else could finish it other than John than Paul.  Nobody knew John as well as Paul did in terms of musical perspectives (and maybe even personally).  If Paul is fine with it, so should the rest of us.  It's a beautiful and haunting last song from the greatest musical output of the 20th century.  I choose to celebrate it for what it is -  I hope others can to."", 'I call it, labored magic.

I’m so very happy that Paul, Giles Martin and Ringo decided to complete this.  That with technology they are finally able to isolate John’s voice is miraculous. It’s a gift for us all. I heard the song first and listened a few times, but I must say that when I saw the video with the song is when it really hit me what a beautiful sentiment this is. It’s a love letter to his friends. The type of friends that you went through everything with…the good, the bad and the ugly. And years later when life is different, you still think of them.  \nAnd you hope and pray that they do the same.  And you how they’ll come round again in the future. \n\nYou mentioned it “sounding like it was from two different eras” and that’s okay with me.
