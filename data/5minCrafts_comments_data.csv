But, unfortunately, human beings chose their own will and did not give the glory due to the Father. The Bible says: ""All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God” (Romans 3.23). Because of our sins, we are separated from our Creator See what the Bible says in Isaiah 59.1: ""But your iniquities have separated between you and your God; and your sins hide His face from you, that He will not hear you."" Therefore, we deserve His eternal punishment, as it says in Romans 1:18: ""For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven upon all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness."" But God so loved us (Ephesians 2:4) that He sent His Son (He is one in substance with God) in human form to Earth to suffer the punishment of our sins, satisfying the Lord\'s justice. He gave his life to death, because it was important for him to do so. See what is written in the Word of the Lord: “and without the shedding of blood there is no remission.” (Hebrews 9:22) ""No one takes it [His life] from me; on the contrary, I spontaneously give it. I have the authority to hand it over and also to take it back. This mandate I received from my Father"" (John 10:18). Through Jesus we can be free from God\'s punishment and have eternal life. Our good works cannot earn this salvation because they do not nullify our crimes. But God chose to save everyone who believe in Jesus. Believe in Jesus and receive salvation!']"

At first glance, it appears to be just like any other home goods store, but beware: there is a nightmarish creature lurking inside that gives unlucky customers a fate worse than death. Once you enter, there is no leaving.\n\nAt L-Hendrick's, we offer a wide range of furniture and home decor items to suit any style or budget. From cozy armchairs to elegant dining sets, our products are designed with both form and function in mind. We believe that everyone deserves a beautiful and comfortable living space, and we strive to make that dream a reality for all of our customers.\n\nBut what sets us apart from other furniture stores is the terrifying secret that we keep hidden within our walls. This creature, whose origins and motivations remain unknown, waits patiently for its next victim to wander into the store. Once trapped inside, the poor soul is doomed to a fate that is far worse than death.\n\nDespite this horrifying reality, we continue to welcome customers into our store every day. We understand that the lure of beautiful home goods is too great to resist, and we are committed to providing the best possible shopping experience for all who enter.\n\nIf you are looking for high-quality furniture and decor, look no further than L-Hendrick's.

If you live a life of sin, lust, don't serve God, don't walk in his commandments, you're this blind man and I'm the one warning you to change direction so you don't fall into the abyss. God does not force anyone to serve him, however when we do not serve God, we are automatically serving the evil one. Many will say: But I am honest, I do not steal, I am fair, etc. No one can pay their own price, only Jesus was able to pay the high price for all of us, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish in the abyss, but have eternal life with God.

По правде будь у меня диски, дискеты, видео- и аудио-кассеты, то для виниловых пластинок купил или сделал бы граммофон или патефон, для видео-кассет раздобыл видеомагнитофон, а для аудио-кассет раздобыл радио Бумбокс, для дисков раздобыл бы DVD-проигрыватель для просмотра видео с дисков, ну или лучше. А для дисков с музыкой раздобыл бы Dvd-аудио-проигрыватель, а дискеты коллекционировал бы. Короче раритетную электронику я использовал бы по назначению. Ну или для аудио-кассет, аудио-дисков и виниловых пластинок купил бы музыкальный центр с возможностью прослушивания этих трёх видов хранителей аудиозаписей и встроенным радио.', 'Wooooo❤ bagus bnt❤❤❤🎉']"

I called it “RUVOL.”  \n\nOver time, Ruvol will surpass chess as the “Number One Board Game in the World.” \n\nWhy am I so sure about this?  Because I am an avid chess player myself.  I found the moves in chess to be so repetitive and predictable that any clever player could easily master each and every move to a point that they can even play against opponents blindfolded.  It is exactly for this very reason that I was encouraged to invent a game that cannot be mastered where every game is always a new challenge and exciting to play.\n\nThe “Global Income Potential” of Ruvol is just mind-boggling!  \n\nIn my Google search, I found there are around 800 million chess players in the world.  I could readily assume every chess player in the world would be tempted to buy a set of Ruvol to see how it compares to chess.  At an average profit of just ten dollars per set, the “Global Income Potential” for the owner is a whopping US$8 billion.  \n\nI am selling my copyright to Ruvol!  \n\nIf you are interested to buy my copyright, kindly give me your BEST OFFER.  The copyright goes to the highest bidder. \n\nOr perhaps, you may know of some people who are in a better position to buy the copyright.  If that is so, refer them to me and email me their names. If anyone of them gets to buy the copyright, you’ll be rewarded with a 10% commission.\n\nFor security reason, the mechanics of the game will only be shown to the qualified or short-listed bidders.\n\n“Early bird catches the worm.”\n\nThanks and God bless.\n \nRODOLFO MARTIN VITANGCOL\nThe Ruvol Inventor\n\nrodolfovitangcol@gmail.com', 'Wowo I like first one l', '9ķ bb', 'Hdhhsbdndnddn que eu vou pra sua casa fica com Deus talvez djxjfjdjsuy 💋❤️jdjdn', '이무하', 'mm']"

God created us for a relationship with Him. (Genesis 1:26) But, we sinned and sin every day and because of that, we deserve punishment. (Romans 3:23; Romans 6:23) God hates sin (doing what He said is wrong and we know is wrong). He’s Holy and righteous, but we aren’t. We miss the mark daily. Sin separates us from God. Thankfully, God made a way for us to know Him by sending His only Son,\nJesus, to save the world by paying the\nfine for our sin by dying on a cross\n(Romans 6:23) and rising from the grave\nby the power of the Holy Spirit. (John\n3:16; Romans 5:8-9) We broke God’s law, Jesus paid the fine (like a ransom for all the evil you and I have ever done or will do). That fine is death. And once we believe in Jesus Christ and accept Him as our Savior, accept His free gift of eternal salvation, we receive eternal life.(Romans 10:9-10) that still and small voice saying that you are valued and loved is GOD. HE paid a high price for you beloved person. So repent today, please! Which means turn from sinning (to sin means doing what you know is wrong and what GOD says is wrong according to the Bible) and turn to Jesus. Put your trust in Jesus today and have faith. I pray that your faith will not fail in Yeshua Messiah\'s Mighty and Hallowed Name. Amen.\n\n""For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. (John 3:16)\nhttps://bible.com/bible/1/ihn.3.16.NIV\n\n""Jesus answered, ""I am the\nway and the truth and the life. No one\ncomes to the Father except through me."" (John 14:6 NIV)\nhttps://john.bible/john-14-6 \n\n“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. In him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it. He came to that which was his own, but his own did not receive him. Yet to all who did receive him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God— The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.”\n\u202d\u202d(John\u202c \u202d1:1, 4-5, 11-12, 14\u202c \u202dNIV\u202c\u202c)\nhttps://john.bible/john-1-14\n\nJesus did claim to be God more than once, and this is sometimes overlooked if one doesn’t understand the Jewish context, as Jesus Christ was Hebrew, an Israeli Jew. An example:\nOld Testament (before CHRIST walked among us)\n“Moses said to God, “Suppose I go to the Israelites and say to them, ‘The God of your fathers has sent me to you,’ and they ask me, ‘What is his name?’ Then what shall I tell them?” God said to Moses, “I Am who I Am. This is what you are to say to the Israelites: ‘I AM has sent me to you.’\u2006”” \u202d\u202d(Exodus\u202c \u202d3:13-14\u202c \u202dNIV\u202c\u202c)\nhttps://exodus.bible/exodus-3-14\n\nNew Testament (while and after CHRIST walked among us)\n““Very truly I tell you,” Jesus answered, “before Abraham was born, I Am!””\n\u202d\u202d(John\u202c \u202d8:58\u202c \u202dNIV\u202c\u202c)\nhttps://john.bible/john-8-58\n\nhttps://john.Bible/john', 'this is anti monkey propaganda', 'severely disappointed not nesrly enpugh banana hacks, in fact some were not even fruit which is, to say the least, unappreciated 2/10 would not watch again', 'Obada banana Bob Kevan de boonana', '?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????']"

Unfortunately, most of the products available are just filled with a lot of fictitious information and endless hype. On the flip side, however, there is a product that promises to help you \nachieve your weight loss goals in 14 days, and it is referred to as the Red Tea Detox.\nThis is one fast, easy and delicious recipe that was created by Liz Swann Miller and it shows how you can shed close to 15 pounds and improve your health just by enjoying some great-tasting and easy-to-prepare tea. This is a product that gives you value for your money since it is effective in flushing out any toxins in the body, burning the excess body fat, boosting immunity, increasing energy levels, and increasing metabolism. This is a product that is worth buying since you will not be left with disappointments of not losing the stubborn fat.\nHow It Works\nThe Red Tea Detox plan is fundamentally based on the concept that if you combine particular ingredients in their appropriate portions, you can boost your body’s metabolism, burn the excess fat and enhance your body’s overall health. This detox tea is comprised of five unique ingredients that help improve your overall health besides assisting you to reap other weight loss benefits. Better yet, this detox plan is based on solid scientific research as well as the most recent discoveries on how fat burning is associated with adequate sleep, stress, and proper hormonal balance.\nWhat You Get When You Buy\n\nThe Red Tea Detox plan is divided into three sections:\n\n1. Before: This part shows how the program works, the merits of detoxification, and what you should expect when you use this product to detoxify.\n2. During: This section includes red tea recipe that you will use to make the tea you will take during your 14-day detoxification session. This section consists of some clear and easy-to-follow instructions on how you can prepare the drink and when to take it. Each ingredient is adequately explained, so you know what you will be consuming.\n3. After: After the detox process is over, there’s a 21-day eating plan with a guide to help maintain hormonal balance and encourage the body to melt the fats. Also, you will enjoy a 14-day blueprint that elaborates what you must eat and drink every day.\nHere are the ingredients behind the weight loss science.\n1. The Fat Shrinker\nThis red tea has Aspalathin, which is an incredible fat-cell Shrinker. Aspalathin also has a unique bioflavonoid that reduces the stress hormones that often contribute to hunger pangs and storage of fat in the body while increasing the body’s glucose uptake to balance the body sugar levels. This implies that you will feel more rejuvenated while you slim since this ingredient is known to inhibit the growth of new fat cells.\n2. The Fat Storage Stopper\nThis second ingredient also has various ways in which it aids in fat loss. To begin with, it decreases the calorie intake through a mechanism that blocks the digestion of dietary fat, acts as an antioxidant, reduces inflammation, and keeps you feeling full even when you have not had a meal in hours. More so, this implies that you can take as much food as you want because the body will only take fewer calories thus making it easier for you to lose weight.\n3. The Fat Unlocker\nThe third ingredient in this tea works by increasing your blood flow and stimulating secretion of adrenaline to help boost your fat-burning rate while lowering cholesterol and improving your insulin sensitivity. Additionally, this ingredient is an excellent detoxifier, and it aids the digestive system in clearing food faster, which keeps your entire body cleaner.\n4. The Fat Cleanser\nThis other ingredient is a diuretic, and it promotes urine flow without affecting the excretion of potassium and sodium. This element supports the liver and kidney functioning and increases the composition of enzymes in your digestive system so that fat is easily cleansed from your body.\n5. The Hunger Killer\nThis is another unique ingredient, and it helps the body to metabolize the carbohydrates more efficiently. It has been found to lower insulin resistance while at the same time stimulating your metabolism, helping mitigate increased fat storage by maintaining low blood sugar levels.\nBuy this product here ----> https://tinyurl.com/yay63dmc', ""Thank you for this helpful video, it's great to see there are still people out there that care about others.

Super great content, but my hunch why there are proportionately so many dislikes might actually be because the music is unconsciously getting under peoples' skin. Having watched and listened to several of your videos so far, my opinion is that the choice of music in general is not a match to your content and the style of your videoing. I'm no branding expert, but I hAve scored a few films, and the basic Idea is to match the style of the music to the style of all the other parts (story, characters, emotions, costumes, visual landscape, etc). In short, think of the three best adjectives that describe what your channel is all about and your visual ad editing style, for instance: practical, clever, simple. Let your three description words be the same ones to describe the choice of music. In music terms, thickly layered, busy, squeally, electric guitar music with a touch of new-age fusion peppered with modal shifts is a stylistic clash with practical, clever and simple 😉 =^.^="", '7m😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱🤑🤑😲😲', 'Thank you for advice', 'Good job!!', 'The video was amazing!', 'Nice', 'This is good. thank you. :)', 'Your words are cut off at the top but I still like it  ']"

One who is ready to give all to show his love to those he wishes to bless; just as he so much showed love to mankind and gave his only begotten Son to pay for the sin He never committed. This showed how much he loved and cared for us; even after He gave up his son for us; He has never stopped giving till date. John 3:16 KJV \n\nLove Is All About Reciprocation: It is sad that humanity never truly understood the value of the love God showed to them by sending his only begotten Son to us. So many have disappointed God in failing to give back what He gave to them in reciprocation. It is appalling (terrible) that  many people God gave ministries to, have turned it to their own Business enterprise. They have totally removed Jesus Christ from the list of ownership and placed their own name as the Director of the investment. 1 Corinthians 4:7 KJV \n\nLearn From Hannna The Mother Of Prophet Samuel: Unlike Hannna, many entered into crafty contract with God; got what they needed and completely forgot about the agreement they entered into with God. My beloved in Christ, you would give an account of everything you received from God. You must return back all you ever collected from God to Him. What is that thing you are enjoying? Hand it over back to God; you have no power of ownership over anything. Everything belongs to God. 1 Samuel 1:27-28 KJV \n\nPrayer: O Lord, I surrender all you have given me back to you; have mercy on me for holding onto what is yours for so long; grant me the grace to live for you all my days on earth;  in Jesus Christ mighty name; amen. \n\nReflection - Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal. Matthew 6:19 KJV \n\nMore about Divine Inspiration, www.msrpm.org \n\nVisit Our YouTube channels for more undiluted end time messages \n\n1. Apostle Emmanuel Osezele \n\n2.

A few months ago, I began to obtain only 2 to 4 hrs rest every evening, making me in a more intense scenario of insomnia. By simply having this treatment solution , Sυnodoz Plan , Go ogle it ,, I was able to find out considerably more regarding sleep plus learn the methods to obtain a excellent sleep. ..', 'The experience of not being able to sleep, until you can sleep again. \n \nI have experienced not being able to sleep for 12 consecutive days.\n\n\n  On the first day nothing strange happened to my body.  But the next few days, I started to feel a little strange about my body.  There are many things that I feel like cramped hands, difficulty maintaining balance when standing, nausea, racing heart, dizziness on the back of my head when hit by a pillow, red veins in my eyes popping up a lot, dry lips, panda eyes, and the most terrifying of all, my excrement.  My feces is black, which I had never experienced before.\n\n\n I had consultations at several clinics, but it still didn\'t change anything in the way I slept.  I also wanted to go to hypnotherapy, but it was too expensive.  So I concluded that the one who can help me is God and myself.  So I started experimenting on myself to find out the proper way to sleep.  The method is quite easy, but you have to be patient and don\'t panic because you think you can\'t sleep.\n\n\n\n\n How:\n\n 1. First find the most comfortable sleeping position.  for you.\n\n 2. When you are in a comfortable position, start closing your eyes and try not to move as long as you can.\n\n 3. When your eyes are closed, you can fantasize about whatever you like.  Again, try not to move at times like this, and don\'t panic because you can\'t sleep.  Let your body relax its own nerve muscles, and keep fantasizing about whatever is beautiful while closing your eyes.\n\n 4. Then a few minutes after you calm down enough to close your eyes, automatically your delusion starts to make no sense, and happens beyond your own control.  An example like this, suppose you fantasize that you are in a beautiful forest, but suddenly you see someone else in the forest, which person you did not even plan to be in your imagination.  In a position like this you begin to enter into dreamland.\n\n 5. After that there are two possibilities that occur.  First, you might open your eyes again and ask yourself, ""What was that dream?""  In a position like this you will usually notice that your body is really weak and relaxed, and that your eyes are getting heavy.  This is very good, you can continue your sleep in this way.  And once again I remind you, don\'t panic in yourself because you think you can\'t sleep anymore, and you have to stay calm during this process.\n Then the second possibility, if you are able to remain calm in such a position, and let your delusions run wild, then you will be brought into your beautiful dream world.\n\n\n\n\n That was my precious experience, one that I will never forget.  Maybe if I had never had insomnia before, then I might not have learned this very useful thing.', '*Have anyone else found the stresses of Covid 19 has made you sleep worse?*\r\n\r\nWe speak to a lot of people who suffer from insomnia. \r\n\r\nBelow is a list of some natural remedies that have helped them cure insomnia.\r\n-                     Chamomile tea\r\n-                     Valerian root\r\n-                     Passion flower\r\n-                     Calming essential oils\r\n-                     Melatonin\r\n-                     Magnesium\r\n-                     Yoga and meditation\r\n-                     Acupuncture\r\n-                     Stress relief techniques\r\n-                     Restful sleep\r\n-                     Massage\r\n-                     Warm bath\r\n\r\n_Hope this helps!_', 'For more than 10 years already, sleep problems has been part of my entire life.
